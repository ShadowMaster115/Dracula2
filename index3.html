            <h2 id="c1">The Road to Castle Dracula</h2>
            <p>
                Jonathan Harker, a lawyer from London, describes his trip to Transylvania in 1875, when he received an invitation from Count Dracula. The Count wanted to buy a house in England and asked Jonathan to bring the documents to his castle. Though he hesitated, his fiancée Mina encouraged him. During the journey, Jonathan noticed the locals’ fear of Dracula, and an innkeeper gave him a cross for protection. As he approached the castle, the atmosphere grew darker and more frightening, with howling wolves and a mysterious driver. Finally, he arrived at the imposing Dracula’s Castle.
            </p>
            
            <h2 id="c2">A Prisoner in the Castle</h2>
            <p>
                Jonathan Harker arrives at Dracula’s Castle, where he is greeted by the mysterious Count. Upon entering, Harker notices that the Count is strong and cold. After eating, they talk throughout the night, and Harker begins to feel uneasy about the castle’s atmosphere. The next day, he finds a note allowing him to explore, but some doors are locked. During the day, Harker finds the library, where the Count has studied England. That night, the Count behaves strangely, and Harker begins to fear he is a prisoner in the castle with no way to escape.
            </p>
            
            <h2 id="c3">The Vampires</h2>
            <p>
                Jonathan Harker is trapped in Dracula's castle, where the Count controls him and delays his departure. One night, he encounters three mysterious women who nearly bite him, but Dracula stops them, claiming Harker as his own. Later, Dracula forces Jonathan to write letters to his fiancée Mina, pretending he is safe and soon returning. Jonathan discovers Dracula's plan to travel to England and tries to escape. He spies on Dracula moving down the castle wall like a creature, and later, finds him resting in a box of earth. Desperate, Jonathan attempts a risky escape.
            </p>
            
            <h2 id="c4">A Visit to Hythe </h2>
            <p>
                Mina anxiously waits for Jonathan’s return from Transylvania, receiving only strange, brief letters from him. In July, she visits her friend Lucy in the seaside town of Hythe, where Lucy’s husband, Dr. Arthur West, is away studying with Professor Van Helsing in Amsterdam. Mina and Lucy enjoy peaceful days, but Lucy begins sleepwalking and acting oddly. After a storm, they learn a strange Russian ship washed ashore with no crew, only a large dog that ran toward the hills. Lucy grows weaker, developing mysterious bite marks on her neck. Then, Mina receives news that Jonathan is safe but unwell in Budapest, and she leaves to care for him. They marry in Budapest and return to England, where Jonathan sees Count Dracula in London. Shocked, he realizes his experiences in the castle were real. Soon after, Mina receives a telegram: Lucy has died. Jonathan explains his terrifying time in Dracula’s castle, fearing what the Count now plans in England.
            </p>
            
            <h2 id="c5">How Lucy Died</h2>
            <p>
                Arthur West visits the Harkers to explain how Lucy died. He shares that upon his return from Amsterdam, Lucy was extremely weak, pale, and thin, and she suffered from disturbing dreams of red eyes and golden dust. Worried, he called Professor Van Helsing, who arrived quickly and discovered that Lucy had lost a lot of blood, so he performed a transfusion.
            </p>
            <p>
                While the transfusion and garlic flowers in the room temporarily helped Lucy, something strange happened one night after Arthur left. The window in her room was broken, the garlic flowers had been removed, and Lucy was near death. She described a man calling to her through the window, and she let him in, behaving in a strange and even cruel manner in her final words. Finally, Van Helsing helped her pass in peace, though he refused to let Arthur kiss her lips, allowing him only to kiss her hand.
            </p>
            <p>
                Arthur believes Lucy is now at peace, but Jonathan and Mina suspect that Dracula had been drinking her blood, fearing that Lucy might have become a vampire as well.
            </p>
            
            <h2 id="c6">The Beautiful Lady of Hythe</h2>
            <p>
                After some days, Arthur West returned to his home in Hythe. Mina and Jonathan, worried but silent, kept watch on the news. One morning, they read about the "Beautiful Lady of Hythe," who had appeared to children in town, leaving them pale and with small red marks on their necks.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fearing this was Lucy, Jonathan quickly summoned Van Helsing. When he arrived, Van Helsing explained that vampires need blood to survive, and they planned to free Lucy’s soul. That night, they found her empty coffin in the cemetery, and, later, they saw her pale figure returning with blood on her lips. With great sadness, they performed the ritual to give her peace.
            </p>
            
            <h2 id="c7">The House of the Vampire</h2>
            <p>
                After several hours of rest, Van Helsing and the group made plans to confront Drácula. They traveled to London to find the papers on Drácula's house, but Jonathan discovered they were missing. Using hypnosis, Van Helsing helped Jonathan remember the house's location near Purfleet. The group traveled to the house, where they found boxes of earth, the vampire's resting places. They placed holy bread inside the boxes to weaken Drácula, but as they were finishing, the vampire returned. A confrontation ensued, but the group managed to escape. When they returned home, they found Mina in danger, almost turned into a vampire after Drácula had made her drink his blood.
            </p>
            
            <h2 id="c8">The Flight of the Vampire </h2>
            <p>
                Dracula's plan fails, and he returns to Transylvania to seek safety. Arthur, Jonathan, and Van Helsing follow him, determined to stop him before he reaches his castle. They discover Dracula is traveling by boat on the Queen Catherine, heading towards Varna, and later to Galatz. Mina, under Dracula’s influence, insists on joining them, offering to help by staying hypnotized to track Dracula. The group hurries to Galatz, unsure whether Dracula will travel by water or land to reach his castle.
            </p>
