            <p>
                My name is Jonathan Harker. I am a lawyer and live in London. About seven years ago, strange and terrible things happened to me. Many of my dear friends were also in danger. Finally, we have decided to tell the story of that dreadful time. Part of my job involves finding houses in England for wealthy people living abroad. At the beginning of 1875, I received a letter from Transylvania, a country in Eastern Europe. The letter was from a rich man named Count Dracula. He wanted to buy a house near London. The Count asked me to find an old house with a large garden. The price of the house was not important. I found him a big, old house in the east of London. I wrote to the Count, and he agreed to buy it. There were many papers he needed to sign. To my surprise, Count Dracula invited me to visit him at his castle in Transylvania. "Bring the papers with you," he wrote in his letter. "I can sign them here."
            </p>
            <p>
                I was very busy and didn’t want to go. Transylvania was far away, and few English people had been there. There wasanother reason as well: I was going to marry my dear Mina in the autumn. I didn’t want to leave England until wewere married. But Mina said I should go. "The Count is a wealthy man," she said. "Perhaps you can do more businesswith him. You can travel almost all the way by train. In two weeks, you’ll be back." So, I accepted Count Dracula’sinvitation. I left England at the end of April. Mina gave me a book about Transylvania to read on the train. On themorning of May 4th, I arrived in Bistritz, a small town in Transylvania. It was a beautiful day. The sun was shiningon the great Carpathian Mountains. Somewhere, high in those mountains, was Castle Dracula, where the Count lived.The coach from Bistritz would take me to the Borgo Pass. There, the Count’s carriage would be waiting for me. Thecoach left the inn in Bistritz at three o’clock.
            </p>
            <p>
                I had six hours to wait. I decided to eat something. No one in the inn spoke English, but the innkeeper spoke some German. He welcomed me, and soon I was eating a good meal. The inn was very busy. I watched all the people in their brightly colored clothes. They were speaking languages I didn’t understand. I drank a little more wine and called the innkeeper. "What can you tell me about Count Dracula?" I asked. "Have you ever seen his castle?" The innkeeper walked away without answering my questions. Everyone in the inn stopped talking. They looked at me with fear and surprise. Then they all began talking at once. I heard the name "Dracula" and another word repeated several times. I looked in my dictionary. They were saying the word "vampire." Where had I read that word before? I opened the book Mina had given me. "There are many old stories about the vampires of Transylvania," I read. "Vampires are men and women who never die. Vampires have long, sharp teeth. They bite the necks of living people. Then they drink their blood. Everyone in Transylvania fears vampires. People often carry a cross to stay safe..." I closed the book quickly. Did people really believe these stories?
            </p>
            <p>
                It was time to go. I paid for my meal. Then I went outside and got on the coach. There was a crowd of people outside the inn. Suddenly, the innkeeper ran forward and spoke to me through the coach window. "Must you go to Castle Dracula?" he said. "Don’t go to that terrible place!" "I have important business with the Count," I replied. "Then take this," said the innkeeper, "and may God help you!" And he put a gold cross on a chain in my hand. As the coach began to move, strange thoughts crossed my mind. Who was this man I was going to meet? Did Count Dracula have strange powers? I couldn’t believe it. The coach began to go faster. The sun shone on the trees and the water of small rivers. There was snow on the tops of the highest mountains. What a beautiful country Transylvania was! The mountains were closer to us now, and the road went higher and higher. The shadows grew longer as the sun began to set behind the mountains. Then, suddenly, the light was gone. The mountains and the sky were dark. The coach went faster and faster. I could hear a terrible sound. It was the howling of wolves. Now the moon was shining. I could see dark shapes near the road. The coach climbed higher and higher. And now I could see a narrow path to the right. The coach stopped. We were at the Borgo Pass. Along the narrow path came a small carriage, pulled by four black horses. When the carriage stopped, its driver shouted, "I have come from Castle Dracula! Where is the Englishman?" "Here!" I replied. The driver jumped from the carriage. He took my bag and grabbed my arm. In a moment, I was sitting beside him, and the black horses were galloping down the narrow path.
            </p>
            <p>
                The driver wore a black cloak, and his hat was pulled down over his face. The mountains were tall, black walls on both sides of us. We were going so fast that I had to hold on to the carriage with both hands. Black clouds covered the moon. The carriage had no lights, and I could see nothing. Wolves were howling all around us. The driver was laughing. As the horses went faster, I closed my eyes in fear. Then, suddenly, the journey was over. The driver pulled me from the carriage. He threw my bag beside me. In a moment, the carriage and the driver had disappeared. I had arrived at Castle Dracula!

            <h2 class="box2" id="c2">Chapter 2: “A Prisoner in the Castle”</h2>
            <p>
                I looked up at the high walls of the castle. There were no lights in any of the windows. In front of me stood a large wooden door. As I stood there, I heard the door opening. It opened slowly. There stood a very tall and old man, holding a lamp in his hand. His hair and face were white, and he was dressed in black. He raised the lamp and said, “Welcome to my home. Enter Castle Dracula, Mr. Harker.” As I stepped inside, Count Dracula took my arm. His grip was incredibly strong, and his hand was cold as ice. The Count carefully closed the door and placed the keys in his pocket. I followed him through long hallways and up spiral staircases. I walked as if in a dream. At last, the Count opened a door and led me into a windowless room. I could see two open doors. Through one, I saw a bedroom. Through the other, I saw food and drink on a table.
            </p>
            <p>
                “When you’re ready, my dear friend,” said the Count, “I will be waiting.”
                Within minutes, I was seated at the table. I was very hungry. The Count told me he had already eaten. Later, we sat together near the fire. The Count spoke excellent English and asked me many questions. I was tired and began to feel very uneasy. The castle was utterly silent, but outside, wolves were howling.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Do you hear the children of the night?” the Count said softly. “Listen to their music!”
            </p>
            <p>
                The face of Count Dracula was very close to mine. The firelight made his eyes shine with a red glow. There was an unpleasant smell in the room. I wondered what it could be. The Count smiled. His lips were very red, and his teeth were long and sharp.
            </p>
            <p>
                “You are tired,” he said. “It is time for you to sleep.”
            </p>
            <p>
                That night, I had strange and terrible dreams. In my dreams, I heard the sound of wolves and eerie laughter. When I woke, it was late in the morning. There was fresh food in the other room and a note from the Count on the table.
            </p>
            <p>
                I must leave you alone today, I read. You may go anywhere in the castle. But some doors are locked. Do not attempt to open them.
            </p>
            <p>
                I saw no one all day. But I found the Count’s library. It was full of books about England, and I spent the day reading them. I was still reading when Count Dracula returned in the evening.
            </p>
            <p>
                “These books are my good friends,” he said. “They have taught me much about your country. And now I have you, Mr. Harker, to converse with.”
                “You speak English very well, Count,” I told him.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Count smiled, showing his sharp white teeth.
            </p>
            <p>
                “You must tell me about my new house,” he said. “And you have papers for me to sign.”
            </p>
            <p>
                I showed Count Dracula the maps and photographs I had brought with me.
            </p>
            <p>
                “The house is about 22 kilometers east of London,” I said. “It is large, and parts of it are very old.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Good,” said the Count. “I have always lived in an old house. I could not live in a new one.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “The gardens have a high wall around them,” I continued. “This is a photograph of the chapel. It is the oldest part of the house.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Then I will be close to the graves of the dead,” Count Dracula said quietly. He held the photograph in his hand. For the first time, I noticed his long, pointed nails. The Count continued talking throughout the night. At one point, I must have fallen asleep. I sat up suddenly. Count Dracula was leaning over me. His breath had a terrible smell. What did it remind me of? As I opened my eyes, he stepped back.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Well, my friend,” Dracula said, “we have been talking all night. You are tired. Go to sleep.”
            </p>
            <p>
                But I did not sleep well. My mind was restless. Again, I had terrible dreams. It was very early when I woke. I decided to get dressed and shave. I looked around my room. To my surprise, there was no mirror. Luckily, I had brought a small shaving mirror with me. I hung it near the window and began shaving.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Good morning, my friend,” said a voice behind me.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was so startled that my razor slipped, and I cut myself. I turned around. There was Count Dracula! He had come up behind me. Why hadn’t I seen his face in my mirror?
            </p>
            <p>
                The Count saw the blood on my face. He made a strange sound, and his hands moved toward my throat. His eyes burned with a fiery red glow. Then his hands touched the cross around my neck, and the fire in his eyes disappeared.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Be careful,” he said. “It is dangerous to cut yourself in Castle Dracula. And this mirror is not needed here.”
            </p>
            <p>
                As he spoke, he threw my mirror out of the open window. It shattered on the stones far below. The Count turned and left the room.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I went to breakfast, he was already gone. I was alone once more. I felt very uneasy. I spent the day exploring the castle. Everywhere I went, I found locked doors. Some windows were open, but they were very high in the castle walls. The ground was hundreds of meters below.
            </p>
            <p>
                There was no way out of the castle. Apart from Count Dracula, I was completely alone.
            </p>
            <p>
                Was I a prisoner in this strange and terrible place?
            </p>
