            <h1>Dracula</h1>
            <h2>Who is the protagonist? What does he do?</h2>
            <p>
                The main character is Jonathan Harker. He is a lawyer and works finding houses in England for rich people.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Why does he agree to go to Transylvania?</h2>
            <p>
                He agrees to go to Transylvania because his wife tells him it is a good opportunity to do business with a very important and rich person, and he might take advantage to get more work with him.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Describe vampires</h2>
            <p>
                Vampires are monsters with red eyes, a white face, very large teeth, and a golden aura around them. When vampires don’t drink blood, they look very old, their faces are very white, and they are very thin. But, when they drink blood, they look full of life: their lips are very red and shiny, their cheeks are pink, and they have a much more athletic body.
            </p>
            
            <h2>What does the owner of the inn give to Jonatan, and why?</h2>
            <p>
                The owner of the inn gives Jonathan a gold cross to protect himself from vampires. In the story, he and characters like Van Helsing use these crosses to scare away or repel vampires.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Where does the novel "Dracula" take place?</h2>
            <p>
                The novel "Dracula" takes place mostly in Dracula's Castle in Transylvania and also in Hythe, England.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Who is the woman who becomes Dracula's obsession?</h2>
            <p>
                Mina becomes Dracula's obsession, as he only turned Lucy into a vampire out of resentment towards the main character.
            </p>
            
            <h2>What is the significance of the garlic in the novel?</h2>
            <p>
                In the novel, garlic is used to scare vampires. Mostly, garlic bread is used to stop Dracula from entering the boxes with earth or coffins, where he rests and regains his power.
            </p>
            
            <h2>What does Harker find strange about Dracula’s castle?</h2>
            <p>
                The main character found it quite strange that the castle was very old, that it had no mirrors, and that most of the doors were closed.
            </p>
            
            <h2>How does he react when he discovers Dracula is a vampire?</h2>
            <p>
                When he discovers that Dracula is a vampire, Harker feels very scared. He doesn’t do anything about it at that moment, but later he tries to escape the castle.
            </p>
            
            <h2>What happens to him after Dracula attack?</h2>
            <p>
                After Dracula attacks him, I think Dracula went to the city to drink blood, and later Harker saw him in his coffin and tried to leave the castle.
